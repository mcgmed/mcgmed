- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcgmed . I'm a doctor and
- 👀 I’m interested in data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Natural Language Processing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical projects with my colleagues.
- 📫 How to reach me: mustafacgoktepe@gmail.com

During my medical career, I became interested in computer science and finally I decided to put this interest into practice. In this wide field, I preferred data science and machine learning subjects because I have worked with scientific medical data, and the benefit of artificial intelligence to human life today and the promise of great hopes for the future excites me.

I have some projects about supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I can use Python (with known libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow) and SQL to perform getting and manipulating data, visualization, and modelling.

Due to my medical knowledge, I believe that I will contribute to better understanding and interpretation of data in the field of healthcare, generating new ideas and facilitating communication with health institutions.

I am very enthusiastic about working in the field of data science and I am open job and project offers.
